# iTracker (initiative tracker)
A simple tool for quickly creating an ordered list of combatants for a D&D encounter.

## Getting Started

I tried making executables using pyinstaller, but right now only the Windows executable seems to work on other machines, whereas the OSX executable only works on mine. Currently learning JavaScript and ReactJS in order to make this a web app.

The instructions below are for running the program with Python3 in the terminal
Step 1) Install python 3  
Step 2) Save iTracker.py and Combatant.py into the same folder  
Step 3) Navigate to that folder through terminal/command prompt   
Step 4) Run the program (i.e. OSX: python3 iTracker.py; Windows: python iTracker.py)  
Step 5) Follow on-screen instructions

### Prerequisites
* Python3
* Knowledge of command line interface

### Under construction
* Standalone Unix executable working
